Assigment 14 Classes and Derived Classes


CIS 1202 Programming Assignment #14
Inheritance
Develop a base and derived classes to represent different types of vehicles.  Then program a short driver to these classes.
Use a source code management tool as you develop this program.  Commit changes frequently using descriptive commit messages.  Push your changes to GitHub or other publicly accessible location for your instructor to clone.
Requirements
1.	Define a base class called Vehicle.  Define the member variables and method prototypes in Vehicle.h, and the implementation of the methods in Vehicle.cpp.
a.	Define member variables for manufacturer and year built
b.	Define a constructor and appropriate getters and setters
c.	Define a displayInfo method to display the contents of the object
2.	Define a Car class that inherits from Vehicle.  Define the member variables and method prototypes in Car.h, and the implementation of the methods in Car.cpp.
a.	Define a member variable for the number of doors
b.	Define a constructor and appropriate getters and setters
c.	Define a displayInfo method to display the contents of the object (call the base class method to display the Vehicle info, then display the Car info)
3.	Define a Truck class that inherits from Vehicle.  Define the member variables and method prototypes in Truck.h, and the implementation of the methods in Truck.cpp.
a.	Define a member variable for the towing capacity
b.	Define a constructor and appropriate getters and setters
c.	Define a displayInfo method to display the contents of the object (call the base class method to display the Vehicle info, then display the Truck info)
4.	Write a main function to test the classes and methods.
a.	Get input from the user for manufacturer and year built, then store this information in a Vehicle object.  Call the displayInfo method and display it on the output.
b.	Get input from the user for manufacturer, year built, and number of doors, then store this information in a Car object.  Call the displayInfo method and display it on the output.
c.	Get input from the user for manufacturer, year built, and towing capacity, then store this information in a Truck object.  Call the displayInfo method and display it on the output.
5.	Use class methods to pass parameters and return values as needed, using only local variables.  Global variables are not allowed.
6.	Use comments to document your program as you see fit.  Include comments at the beginning of your program with your name, the class (with section), and the date.

7.	Submit the URL for your repository to the dropbox.  No screen shots are needed.
